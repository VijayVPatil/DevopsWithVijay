Devops is one which combines different phase of the product release . It combines Development and Operations to increase the efficiency , speed and security of software development and delivery. As the above image shows it collaboration between Dev(Development) and Ops(Operations) . Devops role is responsible for creating streamlined release process.

## Why Devops?
Before the Devops term came into practice in the organisation the Developer needed there application to be deployed to production that will be available to the customers. For this we required a server. That time we used to have roles like System admins , Build and release engineer Server admins.
System Admin: Create and maintain servers
Build and release engineer: Deploy application in application server
Server admin : Create the Application server .

We used to need these roles just to deploy an application to production and it had manual efforts. To automate and ease this process Devops was introduced.
