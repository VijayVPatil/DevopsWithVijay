# Computer Networking
Networking is a practice to exchange the data between nodes over a shared medium or operating system. It also involves management , maintenance and operationsof networks infrastructure software and policies.
Computer networking is everything that makes it possible for computers,servers and other devices to communicate.

Now we will be seeing various newtworking devices that are important to know how data flows in the network.

## Network Devices
### Host:
Host are any device that sends and receives traffic over the network
Client initiates the request and server responds to the request.
Here server is simply a computer with software installed that responds to specific request

### IP Address:
1) IP address is identity of each host. it needs it to communicate on a network to send and receive packets.
2) The purpose of an IP address is to handle the connection between devices that send and receive information across a network
3) IP address is 32 bits
4) Each bit is just 0 and 1 . So IP address is just random 32 1's and 0's 
5) We break it into four octet and convert each octet into decimal number.
6) 1011  0110 1000  1101  0101  1101  1100  1010
7) When IP address are heirarchly assigned they are called Subnetting

### Network
1)A network is what transports the traffic between Hosts
2)Two hosts connected , we get a network.
3) Network can also be defined as logically grouping of host which require similar connectivity.
4) We can have network inside the network called Subnetworks or Subnets

Internet: Network connect to other networks. Now there can be
